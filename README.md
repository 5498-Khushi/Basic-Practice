# 📝 Basic Practice

Welcome to my programming practice repository! 🌱  
This is where I take baby steps toward becoming a better programmer, one small script at a time.

## 🚀 What's This Repo For?

This repository is a collection of basic programs, practice problems, and small experiments I solve as I learn programming concepts.  
It helps me track my growth and stay consistent while learning.
